--- @class Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe.NativeDisableUnsafePtrRestrictionAttribute:System.Attribute By default unsafe Pointers are not allowed to be used in a job since it is not possible for the Job Debugger to gurantee race condition free behaviour. This attribute lets you explicitly disable the restriction on a job.
