--- A Camera eye corresponding to the left or right human eye for stereoscopic rendering, or neither for non-stereoscopic rendering.
--- 
--- A single Camera can render both left and right views in a single frame. Therefore, this enum describes which eye the Camera is currently rendering when returned by Camera.stereoActiveEye during a rendering callback (such as Camera.OnRenderImage), or which eye to act on when passed into a function.
--- 
--- The default value is Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye.Left, so Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye.Left may be returned by some methods or properties when called outside of rendering if stereoscopic rendering is enabled.
--- @class UnityEngine.Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye
UnityEngine.Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye = {
    --- Camera eye corresponding to stereoscopic rendering of the left eye.
    Left = 0,
    --- Camera eye corresponding to stereoscopic rendering of the right eye.
    Right = 1,
    --- Camera eye corresponding to non-stereoscopic rendering.
    Mono = 2,
}
