--- @class UnityEngine.UIElements.MeshGenerationContext Offers functionality for generating visual content of a VisualElement during the generateVisualContent callback.
--- @field visualElement UnityEngine.UIElements.VisualElement property get
---       The element for which VisualElement.generateVisualContent was invoked.
UnityEngine.UIElements.MeshGenerationContext = {}

--- Allocates the specified number of vertices and indices required to express geometry for drawing the content of a VisualElement.
--- @param vertexCount number The number of vertices to allocate. The maximum is 65535 (or UInt16.MaxValue).
--- @param indexCount number The number of triangle list indices to allocate. Each 3 indices represent one triangle, so this value should be multiples of 3.
--- @param texture UnityEngine.Texture An optional texture to be applied on the triangles allocated. Pass null to rely on vertex colors only.
--- @return UnityEngine.UIElements.MeshWriteData An object that gives access to the newely allocated data. If the returned vertex count is 0, then allocation failed (the system ran out of memory).
function UnityEngine.UIElements.MeshGenerationContext:Allocate(vertexCount, indexCount, texture) end
