--- The GrammarRecognizer is a complement to the KeywordRecognizer. In many cases developers will find the KeywordRecognizer fills all their development needs. However, in some cases, more complex grammars will be better expressed in the form of an xml file on disk.
--- The GrammarRecognizer uses Extensible Markup Language (XML) elements and attributes, as specified in the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Speech Recognition Grammar Specification (SRGS) Version 1.0. These XML elements and attributes represent the rule structures that define the words or phrases (commands) recognized by speech recognition engines.
