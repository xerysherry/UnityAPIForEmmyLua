--- @class UnityEngine.Rendering.RenderBufferLoadAction This enum describes what should be done on the render target when it is activated (loaded).
UnityEngine.Rendering.RenderBufferLoadAction = {
    --- When this RenderBuffer is activated, preserve the existing contents of it. This setting is expensive on tile-based GPUs and should be avoided whenever possible.
    Load = 0,
    --- Upon activating the render buffer, clear its contents. Currently only works together with the RenderPass API.
    Clear = 1,
    --- When this RenderBuffer is activated, the GPU is instructed not to care about the existing contents of that RenderBuffer. On tile-based GPUs this means that the RenderBuffer contents do not need to be loaded into the tile memory, providing a performance boost.
    DontCare = 2,
}
