--- @class UnityEngine.Experimental.Audio.AudioSampleProvider Provides access to the audio samples generated by Unity objects such as VideoPlayer.
--- @field consumeSampleFramesNativeFunction function property get
---       Pointer to the native function that provides access to audio sample frames.
--- @field id number property get
---       Unique identifier for this instance.
--- @field trackIndex number property get
---       Index of the track in the object that created this provider.
--- @field owner UnityEngine.Object property get
---       Object where this provider came from.
--- @field valid boolean property get
---       True if the object is valid.
--- @field channelCount number property get
---       The number of audio channels per sample frame.
--- @field sampleRate number property get
---       The expected playback rate for the sample frames produced by this class.
--- @field maxSampleFrameCount number property get
---       The maximum number of sample frames that can be accumulated inside the internal buffer before an overflow event is emitted.
--- @field availableSampleFrameCount number property get
---       Number of sample frames available for consuming with Experimental.Audio.AudioSampleProvider.ConsumeSampleFrames.
--- @field freeSampleFrameCount number property get
---       Number of sample frames that can still be written to by the sample producer before overflowing.
--- @field freeSampleFrameCountLowThreshold number property getset
---       Then the free sample count falls below this threshold, the Experimental.Audio.AudioSampleProvider.sampleFramesAvailable event and associated native is emitted.
--- @field enableSampleFramesAvailableEvents boolean property getset
---       Enables the Experimental.Audio.AudioSampleProvider.sampleFramesAvailable events.
--- @field enableSilencePadding boolean property getset
---       If true, buffers produced by ConsumeSampleFrames will get padded when silence if there are less available than asked for. Otherwise, the extra sample frames in the buffer will be left unchanged.
