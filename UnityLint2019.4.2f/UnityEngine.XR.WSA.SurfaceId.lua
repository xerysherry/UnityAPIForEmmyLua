--- @class UnityEngine.XR.WSA.SurfaceId SurfaceId is a structure wrapping the unique ID used to denote Surfaces.  SurfaceIds are provided through the onSurfaceChanged callback in Update and returned after a RequestMeshAsync call has completed.  SurfaceIds are guaranteed to be unique though Surfaces are sometimes replaced with a new Surface in the same location with a different ID.
--- @field handle number The actual integer ID referring to a single surface.
