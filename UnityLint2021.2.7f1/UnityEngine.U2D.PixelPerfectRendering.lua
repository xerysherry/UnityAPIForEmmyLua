--- @class UnityEngine.U2D.PixelPerfectRendering A collection of APIs that facilitate pixel perfect rendering of sprite-based renderers.
--- @field pixelSnapSpacing number property getset
---       To achieve a pixel perfect render, Sprites must be displaced to discrete positions at render time. This value defines the minimum distance between these positions. This doesnâ€™t affect the GameObject's transform position.
UnityEngine.U2D.PixelPerfectRendering = {}

function UnityEngine.U2D.PixelPerfectRendering.set_pixelSnapSpacing(value) end
