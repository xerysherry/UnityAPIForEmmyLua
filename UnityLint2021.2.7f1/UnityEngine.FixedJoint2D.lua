--- @class UnityEngine.FixedJoint2D:UnityEngine.AnchoredJoint2D Connects two Rigidbody2D together at their anchor points using a configurable spring.
--- @field dampingRatio number property getset
---       The amount by which the spring force is reduced in proportion to the movement speed.
--- @field frequency number property getset
---       The frequency at which the spring oscillates around the distance between the objects.
--- @field referenceAngle number property get
---       The angle referenced between the two bodies used as the constraint for the joint.
