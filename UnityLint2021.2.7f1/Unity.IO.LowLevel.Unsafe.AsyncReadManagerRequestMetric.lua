--- @field IsBatchRead boolean property get
---       Returns whether this read request contained batch read commands.
--- @field State Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.ProcessingState property get
---       The ProcessingState|state of the read request at the time of retrieving the metrics.
--- @field ReadType Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.FileReadType property get
---       The FileReadType|read type (sync or async) of the read request.
--- @field PriorityLevel Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.Priority property get
