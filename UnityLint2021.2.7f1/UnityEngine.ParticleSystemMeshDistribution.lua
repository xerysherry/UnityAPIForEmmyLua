--- @class UnityEngine.ParticleSystemMeshDistribution Sets which method Unity uses to randomly assign Meshes to particles.
UnityEngine.ParticleSystemMeshDistribution = {
    --- Use a uniform random value to give each Mesh an equal chance to appear.
    UniformRandom = 0,
    --- Use per-Mesh weights to make some Meshes appear more often than others. A higher weight value increases the chance of choosing the associated Mesh.
    NonUniformRandom = 1,
}
