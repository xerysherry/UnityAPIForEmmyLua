--- @class UnityEngine.VFX.VFXCameraXRSettings Represents settings that specify how the Visual Effect Graph should handle an XR Camera.
--- @field viewTotal number The number of views the camera has in total. For a normal Camera, this is 1. For a Camera in XR, this is 2.
--- @field viewCount number The number of views to render in the pass. In Unity, there are different methods of rendering a Camera in XR. For multiple pass rendering, viewTotal is 2 and viewCount will be 1. For other XR rendering methods, both viewTotal and viewCount are 2.
--- @field viewOffset number Indicates where to start rendering views in this pass. Currently, the Visual Effect Graph uses this for multiple pass XR rendering. In this case, the first pass value is 0 and the second pass is 1. For other XR rendering methods, this is 0.
