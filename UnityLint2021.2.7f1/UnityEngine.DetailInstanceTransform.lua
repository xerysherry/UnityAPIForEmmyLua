--- @class UnityEngine.DetailInstanceTransform Describes the transform of a Terrain detail object.
--- @field posX number The X coordinate of the detail object in the Terrain's local space. To get the X in world space, add this value to position X of the Terrain.
--- @field posY number The Y coordinate of the detail object in the Terrain's local space. To get the Y in world space, add this value to position Y of the Terrain.
--- @field posZ number The Z coordinate of the detail object in the Terrain's local space. To get the Z in world space, add this value to position Z of the Terrain.
--- @field scaleXZ number The X and Z scale values of the detail object. These two values are always the same.
--- @field scaleY number The Y scale value of the detail object.
--- @field rotationY number The angle, in radians, at which the detail object rotates around the Y-axis.
