--- @class UnityEngine.ForceMode Use ForceMode to specify how to apply a force using Rigidbody.AddForce or ArticulationBody.AddForce.
UnityEngine.ForceMode = {
    --- Add a continuous force to the rigidbody, using its mass.
    Force = 0,
    --- Add a continuous acceleration to the rigidbody, ignoring its mass.
    Acceleration = 5,
    --- Add an instant force impulse to the rigidbody, using its mass.
    Impulse = 1,
    --- Add an instant velocity change to the rigidbody, ignoring its mass.
    VelocityChange = 2,
