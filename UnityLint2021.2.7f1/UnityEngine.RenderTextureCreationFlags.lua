--- @class UnityEngine.RenderTextureCreationFlags Set of flags that control the state of a newly-created RenderTexture.
UnityEngine.RenderTextureCreationFlags = {
    --- Set this flag to allocate mipmaps in the RenderTexture. See RenderTexture.useMipMap for more details.
    MipMap = 1,
    --- Determines whether or not mipmaps are automatically generated when the RenderTexture is modified.
    --- This flag is set by default, and has no effect if the RenderTextureCreationFlags.MipMap flag is not also set.
    --- See RenderTexture.autoGenerateMips for more details.
    AutoGenerateMips = 2,
    --- When this flag is set, reads and writes to this texture are converted to SRGB color space. See RenderTexture.sRGB for more details.
    SRGB = 4,
    --- Set this flag when the Texture is to be used as a VR eye texture. This flag is cleared by default. This flag is set on a RenderTextureDesc when it is returned from GetDefaultVREyeTextureDesc or other VR functions returning a RenderTextureDesc.
    EyeTexture = 8,
    --- Set this flag to enable random access writes to the RenderTexture from shaders.
    --- Normally, pixel shaders only operate on pixels they are given. Compute shaders cannot write to textures without this flag. Random write enables shaders to write to arbitrary locations on a RenderTexture.  See RenderTexture.enableRandomWrite for more details, including supported platforms.
    EnableRandomWrite = 16,
    --- This flag is always set internally when a RenderTexture is created from script. It has no effect when set manually from script code.
    CreatedFromScript = 32,
    --- Clear this flag when a RenderTexture is a VR eye texture and the device does not automatically flip the texture when being displayed. This is platform specific and
    --- It is set by default. This flag is only cleared when part of a RenderTextureDesc that is returned from GetDefaultVREyeTextureDesc or other VR functions that return a RenderTextureDesc. Currently, only Hololens eye textures need to clear this flag.
    AllowVerticalFlip = 128,
    --- When this flag is set, the engine will not automatically resolve the color surface.
    NoResolvedColorSurface = 256,
    --- Set this flag to mark this RenderTexture for Dynamic Resolution should the target platform/graphics API support Dynamic Resolution. See ScalabeBufferManager for more details.
    DynamicallyScalable = 1024,
    --- Setting this flag causes the RenderTexture to be bound as a multisampled texture in a shader. The flag prevents the RenderTexture from being resolved by default when RenderTexture.antiAliasing is greater than 1.
    BindMS = 2048,
