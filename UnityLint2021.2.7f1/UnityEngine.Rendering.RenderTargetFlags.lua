--- @class UnityEngine.Rendering.RenderTargetFlags This enum describes optional flags for the RenderTargetBinding structure.

    None = 0,
    --- The depth buffer bound for rendering may also bound as a samplable texture to the graphics pipeline: some platforms require the depth buffer to be set to read-only mode in such cases (D3D11, Vulkan). This flag can be used for both packed depth-stencil as well as separate depth-stencil formats.
    ReadOnlyDepth = 1,
    --- The stencil buffer bound for rendering may also bound as a samplable texture to the graphics pipeline: some platforms require the stencil buffer to be set to read-only mode in such cases (D3D11, Vulkan). This flag can be used for both packed depth-stencil as well as separate depth-stencil formats.

    --- Both depth and stencil buffers bound for rendering may be bound as samplable textures to the graphics pipeline: some platforms require the depth and stencil buffers to be set to read-only mode in such cases (D3D11, Vulkan). This flag can be used for both packed depth-stencil as well as separate depth-stencil formats.
    ---                 This flag is a bitwise combination of RenderTargetFlags.ReadOnlyDepth and RenderTargetFlags.ReadOnlyStencil.
