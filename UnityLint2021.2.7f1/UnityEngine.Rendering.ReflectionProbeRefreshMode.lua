--- @class UnityEngine.Rendering.ReflectionProbeRefreshMode An enum describing the way a real-time reflection probe refreshes in the Player.
UnityEngine.Rendering.ReflectionProbeRefreshMode = {
    --- Causes the probe to update only on the first frame it becomes visible. The probe will no longer update automatically, however you may subsequently use RenderProbe to refresh the probe
    --- 
    --- See Also: ReflectionProbe.RenderProbe.
    OnAwake = 0,
    --- Causes Unity to update the probe's cubemap every frame.
    --- Note that updating a probe is very costly. Setting this option on too many probes could have a significant negative effect on frame rate. Use time-slicing to help improve performance.
    --- 
    --- See Also: ReflectionProbeTimeSlicingMode.
    EveryFrame = 1,
    --- Sets the probe to never be automatically updated by Unity while your game is running. Use this to completely control the probe refresh behavior by script.
