---       (Read Only) Brush UV origin, in XY space.
--- @field brushU UnityEngine.Vector2 property get
---       (Read Only) Brush U vector, in XY space.
--- @field brushV UnityEngine.Vector2 property get
---       (Read Only) Brush V vector, in XY space.
--- @field targetOrigin UnityEngine.Vector2 property get
---       (Read Only) Target XY origin, in Brush UV space.
--- @field targetX UnityEngine.Vector2 property get
---       (Read Only) Target X vector, in Brush UV space.
--- @field targetY UnityEngine.Vector2 property get
---       (Read Only) Target Y vector, in Brush UV space.
