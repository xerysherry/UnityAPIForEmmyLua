--- @class Unity.Collections.NativeArrayOptions NativeArrayOptions lets you control if memory should be cleared on allocation or left uninitialized.
Unity.Collections.NativeArrayOptions = {
    --- Uninitialized memory can improve performance, but results in the contents of the array elements being undefined.
    --- In performance sensitive code it can make sense to use NativeArrayOptions.Uninitialized, if you are writing to the entire array right after creating it without reading any of the elements first.
    --- 
    UninitializedMemory = 0,
    --- Clear NativeArray memory on allocation.
    ClearMemory = 1,
}
