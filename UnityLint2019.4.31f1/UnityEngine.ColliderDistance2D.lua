--- @class UnityEngine.ColliderDistance2D Represents the separation or overlap of two Collider2D.
--- @field pointA UnityEngine.Vector2 property getset
---       A point on a Collider2D that is a specific distance away from pointB.
--- @field pointB UnityEngine.Vector2 property getset
---       A point on a Collider2D that is a specific distance away from pointA.
--- @field normal UnityEngine.Vector2 property get
---       A normalized vector that points from pointB to pointA.
--- @field distance number property getset
---       Gets the distance between two colliders.
--- @field isOverlapped boolean property get
---       Gets whether the distance represents an overlap or not.
--- @field isValid boolean property getset
---       Gets whether the distance is valid or not.
