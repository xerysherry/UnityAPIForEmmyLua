--- @class UnityEngine.Experimental.GlobalIllumination.SpotLightPyramidShape Use this Struct to help initialize a LightDataGI structure as a pyramid-shaped spot light.
--- @field instanceID number The light's instanceID.
--- @field shadow boolean Specifies whether the light casts shadows or not. This is true if the light does cast shadows and false otherwise.
--- @field mode UnityEngine.Experimental.GlobalIllumination.LightMode The lightmode.
--- @field position UnityEngine.Vector3 The light's position.
--- @field orientation UnityEngine.Quaternion The light's orientation.
--- @field color UnityEngine.Experimental.GlobalIllumination.LinearColor The direct light color.
--- @field indirectColor UnityEngine.Experimental.GlobalIllumination.LinearColor The indirect light color.
--- @field range number The light's range.
--- @field angle number The opening angle of the shorter side of the pyramid light.
--- @field aspectRatio number The aspect ratio for the pyramid shape. Values larger than 1 extend the width and values between 0 and 1 extend the height.
--- @field falloff UnityEngine.Experimental.GlobalIllumination.FalloffType The falloff model to use for baking the pyramid light.
