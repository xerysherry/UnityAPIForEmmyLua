--- @class UnityEngine.SoftJointLimit The limits defined by the CharacterJoint.
--- @field limit number property getset
---       The limit position/angle of the joint (in degrees).
--- @field spring number property getset
---       If greater than zero, the limit is soft. The spring will pull the joint back.
--- @field damper number property getset
---       If spring is greater than zero, the limit is soft.
--- @field bounciness number property getset
---       When the joint hits the limit, it can be made to bounce off it.
--- @field contactDistance number property getset
---       Determines how far ahead in space the solver can "see" the joint limit.
--- @field bouncyness number
