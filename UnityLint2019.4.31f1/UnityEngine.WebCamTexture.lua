--- @class UnityEngine.WebCamTexture:UnityEngine.Texture WebCam Textures are textures onto which the live video input is rendered.
--- @field devices UnityEngine.WebCamDevice[] property get
---       Return a list of available devices.
--- @field autoFocusPoint System.Nullable`1 property getset
---       This property allows you to set/get the auto focus point of the camera. This works only on Android and iOS devices.
--- @field isDepth boolean property get
---       This property is true if the texture is based on depth data.
--- @field isPlaying boolean property get
---       Returns if the camera is currently playing.
--- @field deviceName string property getset
---       Set this to specify the name of the device to use.
--- @field requestedFPS number property getset
---       Set the requested frame rate of the camera device (in frames per second).
--- @field requestedWidth number property getset
---       Set the requested width of the camera device.
--- @field requestedHeight number property getset
---       Set the requested height of the camera device.
--- @field videoRotationAngle number property get
---       Returns an clockwise angle (in degrees), which can be used to rotate a polygon so camera contents are shown in correct orientation.
--- @field videoVerticallyMirrored boolean property get
---       Returns if the texture image is vertically flipped.
--- @field didUpdateThisFrame boolean property get
---       Did the video buffer update this frame?
--- @field mipmapCount number
--- @field graphicsFormat UnityEngine.Experimental.Rendering.GraphicsFormat
--- @field width number
--- @field height number
--- @field dimension UnityEngine.Rendering.TextureDimension
--- @field isReadable boolean
--- @field wrapMode UnityEngine.TextureWrapMode
--- @field wrapModeU UnityEngine.TextureWrapMode
--- @field wrapModeV UnityEngine.TextureWrapMode
--- @field wrapModeW UnityEngine.TextureWrapMode
--- @field filterMode UnityEngine.FilterMode
--- @field anisoLevel number
--- @field mipMapBias number
--- @field texelSize UnityEngine.Vector2
--- @field updateCount number
--- @field imageContentsHash UnityEngine.Hash128
--- @field name string
--- @field hideFlags UnityEngine.HideFlags
